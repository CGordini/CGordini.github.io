### The Driver

<img class="profile" src="/assets/images/cory.jpg"/> I've always liked cars, ever since I was driving Hot Wheels on my city carpet. I taught myself how to do basic wrenching on my first car, a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am coupe, got into drag racing with my 2007 Ford Mustang, and in spring of 2016, I went to my first Open Track Day. I've been hooked ever since, now running in my heavily modified 1991 Mazda MX-5 Miata.

I have progressed from a novice intimidated by everything on-track, to an instructor for <a href="https://www.summertrackdays.com">Summer Track Days</a>, teaching others not to be intimidated and to drive safe, smooth, and fast.

This marks my second year competing in <a href="https://www.grid.life">#GRIDLIFE</a> ((Track Battle: Street Mod)).
