### Professionally

I am a proud alumnus of the University of Michigan (Class of 2014), having received my Bachelors of Science in Engineering from their College of Computer Science. 

I am currently looking for employment after working as a (senior) software engineer for Thomson Reuters for a decade; you can find my resume on my Contact page.

My speciality there was programming in C#, developing various features, while also focusing on creation and automation of a build platform that allowed our product to have testable nightlies. I built this platform from the ground up, involving many layers of scripts interacting with a YAML build pipeline, Git repositories, and Azure Dev Ops build agents hosted on AWS EC2 instances. 

My overall goal is simply to earn a living and pay for my dog and my toys.

### Personally

I am a proud dog-dad to a <a class="hover_img" href="/assets/images/cassie.jpg">lab/pit mix<span><img src="/assets/images/cassie.jpg" height="228px" width="345px"/></span></a>, and I either play video games (often streaming on Twitch), or watch others play games I neither have the time nor energy to beat. My main hobby revolves around <a class="hover_img" href="/assets/images/miata.png">my car<span><img src="/assets/images/miata.png" height="105px" width="283px"/></span></a>, which I wrench on in my garage and built from the ground up; then drive in open track days (OTDs) and high-performance driving events (HPDEs) throughout the state of Michigan. 

I've taken to competing in <a href="https://www.grid.life">#GRIDLIFE</a>, in the StreetMod class, and if you attend their Midwest Fest, come find me and say hi! I have a handful of sponsors I am incredibly grateful for, and wouldn't do this without their support.

I am directly involved with the organization <a href="https://www.summertrackdays.com">Summer Track Days</a>, and you can often find me instructing novices at their events all around the state of Michigan, as well as helping manage logistics.
