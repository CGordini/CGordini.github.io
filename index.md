### Professionally

I am a proud alumnus of the University of Michigan (Class of 2014), having received my Bachelors of Science in Engineering from their College of Computer Science. 

I am currently a Payroll Engineer for <a href="https://www.pointandpay.com/">Point And Pay</a>, working with Java code primarily.

My previous employment was working as a (senior) software engineer for <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en">Thomson Reuters</a>, which I did for a decade.

My speciality there was programming in C#, developing various features, while also focusing on creation and automation of a build platform that allowed our product to have testable nightlies. I built this platform from the ground up, involving many layers of scripts interacting with a YAML build pipeline, Git repositories, and Azure Dev Ops build agents hosted on AWS EC2 instances. 

You can find my resume on my <a href="/contact/#resume">Contact</a> page

My overall goal is simply to earn a living and pay for my little family, and my toys.

### Personally

I am a proud dog-dad to a <a class="hover_img" href="/assets/images/jaina.jpg">lab/pit mix<span><img src="/assets/images/jaina.jpg" height="228px"/></span></a> named Jaina - about a year old and absolutely a "velcro-dog"...and part shark. I either play video games (often streaming on Twitch), or watch others play games I neither have the time nor energy to beat. My main hobby revolves around <a class="hover_img" href="/assets/images/miata.png">my car<span><img src="/assets/images/miata.png" height="105px" width="283px"/></span></a>, which I wrench on in my garage and built from the ground up; then drive in time attack competitions, open track days (OTDs) and high-performance driving events (HPDEs) throughout the Midwest. 

I've taken to competing in <a href="https://www.grid.life">#GRIDLIFE</a>, in the StreetMod class, and if you attend their Midwest Fest, come find me and say hi! I have a handful of <a href="https://www.corygordinier.com/sponsors">sponsors</a> I am incredibly grateful for, and wouldn't do this without their support.

I am directly involved with the organization <a href="https://www.summertrackdays.com">Summer Track Days</a>, and you can often find me instructing novices at their events all around the state of Michigan, as well as helping manage logistics.
