title: Gingerman - SCCA Track Night in America
---

As a preface, this was one of my favorite track days I've ever done in my life, and as previously mentioned, I've done 20 to 30 at Gingerman alone. Like I mentioned in my [previous post](/posts/2019/07/gingerman-scca/), it's sometimes more fun to be a shark in a pond of minnows, and that's how I felt out there. I count in my first session alone blowing past 8 cars, most of which had more horsepower than me.

[Track Nights in America](https://www.tracknightinamerica.com/) are a really cool unique experience. You tell your boss you're taking a half-day of PTO ahead of time, pencil it into your schedule, leave the office around noon, and get to South Haven just in time for the driver's meeting and your first run out. A bad day at the track always beats a good day at the office, and this wasn't a bad day at the track at all.

As a matter of fact, that's exactly what a good friend of mine and I did -- we left our respective jobs at noon and caravaned out, complete with walkie-talkies. I can't wait to do this again.

Unfortunately, said good friend got roped into roadside-maintenance at the dead of night -- one of my radiator hoses finally blew (yay, 30 year old car) and you can see my coolant temp skyrocketing at the end of Session 2 as I come off track. This is why there was no session 3. I feel legitimately bad that he got roped into repair, and I definately owe him a dinner.

Still, I wouldn't trade this particular experience overall for the world.
