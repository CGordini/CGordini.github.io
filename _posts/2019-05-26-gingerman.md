title: Gingerman Track Day with AutoInterests
---

Every Memorial Weekend for the last four years I've made it a point to at least TRY to make it out to Gingerman Raceway in South Haven, Michigan for [AutoInterests'](https://autointerests.com/) annual open track day.

I *think* I've only missed it once, and attending it in my old Mustang was what got me hooked on racing in the first place.

If you haven't heard the story, a friend-of-a-friend's girlfriend heard I had a Mustang, and her then boyfriend, now husband (wow, time flies) _also_ had a Mustang, discuss!

So he ended up inviting me out, and yeah, hooked. We've grown to be good friends over the years, and I'm amused that both of us have since sold the Mustangs we had when we first met, in favor of more devoted track day toys.

AutoInterests runs two days at Gingerman every Memorial Weekend -- Saturdays your usual clockwise, Sundays counterclockwise. I am not immensely fond of counterclockwise, frankly, but when my friends like him are already there, or I have other friends willing to make devoted time on Sundays to hang, then I'm willing to bite the "I suck at this direction" bullet.

This was the first testing of my [new A/V setup](/posts/2019/01/race-tech/), and there were certainly a handful of bugs, but overall, a track day where:  
a) very little things break (some always do. _always._ I think I split my exhaust header on this one due to a failed motor mount?)  
b) I am able to successfully test some code I slung myself  
c) I spend time with friends  

is always a big win in my book.

((warning: this was before I figured out I needed a pop filter/wind block on the GoPro mic.))
