title: Gingerman Track Day - Motor State Challenge 2019
---

The [Motor State Challenge hosted by Lane Automotive](https://www.motorstate.com/motor-state-challenge/) is another one of those "I do this every single year if I can" events, and for the same reason as my annual [Memorial Weekend Gingerman trip](/posts/2019/05/gingerman/) - the same group of friends run both.

It is a little intimidating to be driving a tiny Japanese roadster amidst a sea of Corvettes, Camaros, and Mustangs - the event largely caters to the muscle-car crowd (as does a fair share of Lane Automotives' products), and Gingerman itself is a muscle-car-friendly course.

Which makes it all the more fun when I manage to get past something more expensive and powerful than me. Doesn't happen often, but it does. And its an event that is passenger-friendly...usually.

This one was _insanely_ hot, something like 105F in the shade, which really makes me rethink my strategy of "drive tiny convertible with no A/C and no tow rig across the state", let alone it being the second of three events planned within about a week - a _lot_ of wear and tear for a 30 year old car. 

And a newer generation turbo'd Mustang GT350 blew its engine and dropped oil all over the track, cutting the day short.

I also somehow managed to lose all film of my first session out.

((warning: this was before I figured out I needed a pop filter/wind block on the GoPro mic.))
