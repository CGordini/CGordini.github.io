title: Waterford Track Day - Track-Organized
---

Every year, Waterford Hills arranges something around [8 different open track days](http://www.waterfordhills.com/events-calendar.html). I actually got involved with being a corner worker and flagging some of them, and in return, they allowed me to do their last open track day of the year for a price I couldn't refuse.

This was overall a very enjoyable day -- Waterford is a bit scarier of a track compared to Gingerman, because Gingerman is farmland and has more runoff. But Waterford is the great equalizer for Miatas versus Muscle -- and passing a giant Dodge Challenger always feels good. That's _incredibly_ difficult to do at Gingerman, as the straights just demolish whatever advantage I can gain in the turns.

No parts broke, the streaming equipment worked well, and I got to show people a good time. Wins all around.
