More deep-dives into data (again, collected with the Dual SkyPro 10hz receiver), more comparisons, and more tweaks to how the data is displayed.

First, let's compare me, on Hoosier SM7's (40TW, <span style="color:purple;">purple</span>), to me, on Falken Azenei RT615K+'s (200TW, <span style="color:green;">green</span>). Keep in mind that by the end of the day, I [blew up my engine](https://i.imgur.com/ms949Wq.png), so I have opinions and concerns about how much power I was really putting down...

The easy analysis is line, as seen in the map. Hoosiers were a little tighter-lined (3-4-5, 11), but in general, I know what I'm doing here enough to not see any significant differences.

Noting when the "time lost" steeply rises is interesting - it always corresponds to carrying more speed in the turn (see 2, 8). In general, that's due to me braking less hard and carrying more speed, because I trust the tires to grip more. 

See also: 2, 6, 7, where the valley of speed loss isn't as deep on Hoosiers as it was on the Falkens. _Theoretically_, every single turn should have been like that, which means I was braking _too_ hard and not trusting the tires enough; possibly being gunshy due to a bad spin in 3 during my first session.

Focusing on 8 in particular, I just didn't feel comfortable all day there, it felt slippery (I hear a handful of reasons/excuses for this), and it shows in a line intersection on the GPS v Speed graph at 9. 

Ideally, I wouldn't have lost speed heading into 9 (or at least not as much), come into 10B carrying WAY more speed, and continued gaining time. Instead, as the graph shows, I actually wasn't doing as good as I was on the Falkens, and that affected my overall time gained for the rest of the lap! 

Even with my near-perfect line, even with my later, harder braking, there's plenty of time to be gained when running Hoosiers - this'll just require practice.

Let's do the exact same analysis, but this time around, <span style="color:purple;">me</span> versus the [previously mentioned](/posts/2020/06/gingerman-3/) 1.8L running Nitto NT01 tires (100TW, <span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span>)

As far as lines go, the only real difference is he swings wings *way* wider in 2. I could try going that route (and not braking) and see what that does for my lap times - I brake lightly in 2 to settle the car before apex. Minor differences in 1 and 11 too, but the rest of the lap is just about perfectly identical. I actually _love_ how close the overlap is from 4 to 10B.

Now, for the crux of the matter: I brake _way_ too much. My valleys are deeper in almost every single turn (except 2 and 10B). The _good_ news is I brake later in 1 and 2, but there is just SO much time lost due to braking later.

The "time lost" graph is almost a perfect straight line from 3 onwards, reflecting that at no point is he doing extremely better than me, but the difference in speed (and therefore time lost) is very consistent. In other words, if I did everything else exactly the same, but just carried a little more speed throughout, we'd have perfect overlap.

Note again the difference between 10B and 11 on that long, long straight. The slight power difference does, in fact, make a difference...
