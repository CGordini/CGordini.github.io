title: New Beginnings
---

I was not overly fond of my own personal website. So I hired a good friend of mine to create this one.

The "downside" is now there's a very large backlog of things to add from over the years.

I'm working on that.

The upside is I have a very easy method to do so moving forward, and have a general idea of how I want to do so.

So. Welcome to the new me.
