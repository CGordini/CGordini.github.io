title: Gingerman - SCCA Track Night in America (Part 1)
---

Incredibly spur of the moment, and reeling off the massive adventure (and expense) that was [Mid-Ohio](/posts/2020/06/mid-ohio/), I was informed that my company was giving me Friday off work, which opened me up to the thought of, once again, taking a half-day on a Thursday and traveling all the way out to Gingerman and back for a [SCCA Track Night in America](https://www.tracknightinamerica.com/).

That's 2 and a half hours each way, about an hour of solid track time (three 20 minute sessions), and a heck of a lot of praying nothing breaks on the car (unlike [last time](/posts/2019/08/gingerman/)). But it certainly beats being at the office, especially after the events of 2020 have mandated a lot of not getting outside.

All in all, I'd rate this one somewhere around a 7 or 8 out of 10 - went fast, didn't die, only had one major "moment" (embarrassing spin in a whole new place on the track, see the third video); but was nowhere near as fast as I had been in the past (I've effortlessly done 2:02's previously and I thought I'd do even better this time out given more practice and understanding -- nope, the mystical < 2:00 still eludes me), and felt I was fighting for grip all afternoon long. I honestly thought I had a good chance to set a new personal best, and instead, was still a second off my previous one.

My streaming setup continues to struggle in the dead zone that is the farmlands of the west coast of Michigan, and I managed to miss out on cataloguing lap times on one of my three sessions.

However, this all did provide another interesting opprotunity to look at some data...and compare to [the Mid-Ohio data review](/posts/2020/06/lets-talk-data). 

To be continued...
