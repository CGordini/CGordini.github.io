                                <p>Immortan is a race shop out of Southeastern Michigan that specializes in Miatas. They built my current motor, and have never hesitated to help me with any of my projects. If not in the shop, you can often find them at the track themselves; lead mechanic Chris Murray is competing in #GLTC this season in his K-swapped Honda Civic.</P>

                                <p>Cherry Creek Cellars is a winery located just a little south of Jackson, MI. They've won quite a few regional awards for their wine, and Winemaker Patrick Spensley has been immensely supportive as a primary sponsor of my racing efforts. Known for outdoor concerts, they are planning on doing some car shows this season featuring yours truly.</p>

                                <p>Cobalt, located right out of my hometown, produces compounds for brake pads, and is used by amateurs and professionals alike. Eddie Nakato and his team put these pads on their own cars, and have gone out of their way to produce Wilwood-sized pads for my own. You can find them in the IMSA Pilot Challenge paddock this season with the #14 Porsche Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport.</p>

                                <p>WrapDetroit are graphic application experts found on the outskirts of Detroit; this last year, they redid the livery for my own racecar, as well as various liveries for IMSA GT3 Ford Mustangs celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Mustang. Their speed and quality were downright impressive as a first time wrap customer, and they have gone out of their way to supply my friends and I with extra bits and pieces as we compete in #GRIDLIFE.</p>
