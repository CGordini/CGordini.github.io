HOW TO RUN/BUILD/ETC

0) Make sure all dependencies are installed:
	>npm install -g grunt-cli
	>npm install -g grunt
	>npm install grunt --save-dev
	>npm install -g bower
	>npm install
	>bower install;

1) Check that App/index.html is working after [any changes].

2) Run "grunt build" and make sure dist/index.html is working.

3) Copy *everything* from dist/* into ~ ... otherwise the Amazon S3 redirection won't pick it up.
